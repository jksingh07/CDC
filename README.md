# CDC (CHANGE DATA CAPTURE)
**Change Data Capture / Replication on Going using PySpark and AWS Services such as S3, RDS, DMS, LAMBDA, GLUE etc.**

## Project Description Summary

The proposed project aims to implement a change data capture (CDC) system that captures and replicates ongoing changes in a database to another storage system. The primary objective of this project is to create a data leak out of the database and track every change that occurs, including 
- Insertion, 
- Deletion, 
- Modification

The CDC system will involve developing a pipeline that continuously monitors the database and sends the changes to a file or another HDFC storage system. The pipeline will be responsible for identifying and recording all modifications in the database and forwarding them to the storage system for storage and future retrieval.

The project will require the creation of a detailed architecture for the CDC system from scratch. The architecture will encompass all aspects of the system, including data flow, data transformation, and data storage. The system will be designed to be scalable, flexible, and robust to handle large amounts of data and accommodate any changes that may occur in the future.

Overall, the proposed project will provide an efficient and reliable solution for capturing and replicating ongoing changes in a database to another storage system. It will help organizations to monitor their databases and ensure that all changes are tracked and recorded accurately, thus enhancing data management and decision-making processes.
